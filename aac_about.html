	<h class="detail_des_h" id="history">History:</h>
				<p class="detail_des_p">AAC has a brief history. The seed was sown by eminent statistician Prof. S. N. Narahari Pandit way back in the year 2004. It started as a discussion forum where faculty members from various disciplines would meet to interact about the latest scientific research. It continued to function that way till Prof. S. R. K. Iyengar joined GRIET in 2004. A fresh lease of life was infused during his stay particularly from 2008 to 2012, when he retired from active service. Currently AAC has embraced all engineering departments of GRIET with active contribution from not just the faculty but also seniors.</p><p  class="detail_des_p">
As the name suggests, AAC excites students and staff to work on inter-disciplinary projects leading to out of the box thinking. It is very heartening to mention that both senior and talented young faculty members are associated with AAC. Students work with them with a free mind which produces some high-quality output. AAC designs and executes projects for students, organizes workshops on specialized engineering software and hardware tools and also organizes special lectures which are domain specific.</p><p  class="detail_des_p">
An AAC lab under this center was established by senior AAC students in 2018-19 involving ARDUINO and RASPBERRY PI applications to carry out mini projects.</p><p class="detail_des_p">
Students can be admitted at the beginning of the first and second year of B.Tech. Lateral entry students are also admitted.

People who are speech-impaired    face difficulty in communicating with others who do not know the sign language or their gestures . Our product converts gestures (standard Indian sign language ) into audio output by using machine learning
People who are speech-impaired face difficulty in communicating with others who do not know the sign language. This project aims at eliminating this communication gap. This is done by using a prototype hand worn glove which converts hand gestures into speech, thus enabling speech-impaired people to effectively communicate with everyone. This would help the billions of lives worldwide who are speech-impaired
